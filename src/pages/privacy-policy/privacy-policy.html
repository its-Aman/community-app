              Dear Rajasthan Association UK community and friends,
              <br>
              The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes effective on 25 May 2018. The aim of GDPR is to protect all UK & EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in an increasingly data driven world that is vastly different from the time in which the previous Data Protection Directive was established. 
              <br>            
              Rajasthan Association UK (RA UK) wishes to ensure that we have the consent of each and everyone whose contact details we have in our database.
